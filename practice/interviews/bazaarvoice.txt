**Palindrome**
 
 A string is a palindrome if it is read the same from forward or backward.
 
 For example, 'dad' reads the same either from forward or backward, so the word 'dad' is a palindrome.
 
 Similarly, 'madam' is also a palindrome, as is 'noon'.
 
 _In your preferred language (either JS or Python), write a function to:_
 
 - Part I - Check if a string is a palindrome using a For Loop
 - Part II - Check if a string is a palindrome without iteration, using only built in (e.g. Array, String) functions.
